#### Chaikin Money Flow Strategy

The [ChaikinMoneyFlowStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#ChaikinMoneyFlowStrategy) uses the _cmf_ values that are generated by the [Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)](volume_indicators.md#chaikin-money-flow-cmf) indicator function to provide a _BUY_ action when _cmf_ is less than zero, a _SELL_ action when _cmf_ is greather than zero, a _HOLD_ action otherwise.

```Golang
actions := indicator.ChaikinMoneyFlowStrategy(asset)
```

#### Ease of Movement Strategy

The [EaseOfMovementStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#EaseOfMovementStrategy) uses the _emv_ values that are generated by the [Ease of Movement (EMV)](volume_indicators.md#ease-of-movement-emv) indicator function to provide a _BUY_ action when _emv_ is greather than zero, and a _SELL_ action when _emv_ is less than zero, a _HOLD_ action otherwise.

```Golang
actions := indicator.EaseOfMovementStrategy(asset)
```

#### Force Index Strategy

The [ForceIndexStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#ForceIndexStrategy) uses the _fi_ values that are generated by the [Force Index (FI)](volume_indicators.md#force-index-fi) indicator function to provide a _BUY_ action when _fi_ is greather than zero, and a _SELL_ action when _fi_ is less than zero, a _HOLD_ action otherwise.

```Golang
actions := indicator.ForceIndexStrategy(asset)
```

#### Money Flow Index Strategy

The [MoneyFlowIndexStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#MoneyFlowIndexStrategy) uses the _mfi_ values that are generated by the [Money Flow Index (MFI)](volume_indicators.md#money-flow-index-mfi) indicator function to provide a _SELL_ action when _mfi_ is greather than or equal to 80, and a _BUY_ action when _mfi_ is less than or equal to 20.

```Golang
actions := indicator.MoneyFlowIndexStrategy(asset)
```

#### Negative Volume Index Strategy

The [NegativeVolumeIndexStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#NegativeVolumeIndexStrategy) uses the _nvi_ values that are generated by the [Negative Volume Index (NVI)](volume_indicators.md#negative-volume-index-nvi) indicator function to provide a _BUY_ action when _nvi_ is less than its 255-period EMA, and a _SELL_ action when it is greather than its 255-period EMA, otherwise a _HOLD_ action.

```Golang
actions := indicator.NegativeVolumeIndexStrategy(asset)
```

#### Volume Weighted Average Price Strategy

The [VolumeWeightedAveragePriceStrategy]([./volumeWeightedAveragePriceStrategy.ts](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#VolumeWeightedAveragePriceStrategy)) uses the values that are generated by the [Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)](volume_indicators.md#volume-weighted-average-price-vwap) indicator function to provide a _BUY_ action when the _closing_ is below the _VWAP_, and a _SELL_ action when the _closing_ is below the _VWAP_, a _HOLD_ action otherwise.

```Golang
actions := indicator.VolumeWeightedAveragePriceStrategy(asset)
```
